# üß† Agentic AI for Banking, Loans, and Fraud Detection

This project is an **Agentic AI system** for banking, loan processing, and fraud detection, built with LangChain, LangGraph, and LLMs (Groq, OpenAI). It features modular agents, robust session management, CLI and Streamlit frontends, and escalation to human operators.

## üèóÔ∏è Main Components

- **Loan Processing Workflow**: Modular agents for user interaction, data query, geo-policy validation, risk assessment, agreement presentation, salary extraction, and escalation.
- **Session Management**: Persistent sessions (resume, list, status) via `SessionManager`.
- **CLI Frontend**: `run_loan_cli.py` for interactive or automated loan processing.
- **Human Escalation**: Automated escalation to human operators via dashboard if agents fail.
- **Data & Policy**: Loan purpose policy (`loan_purpose_policy.json`), sample loans (`sample_loans.csv`).


## üí° Capabilities

- **Banking Agent**: Account, card, transaction services.
- **Fraud Agent**: Risk score analysis, anomaly detection, compliance checks.
- **Loan Agent**: Credit risk profiling, EMI affordability, geo-policy checks.
- **Session Management**: Resume, list, and status of loan sessions.
- **Human Escalation**: Operator dashboard for unresolved cases.

## üìå Notes

## ‚è∏Ô∏è How to Interrupt and Resume a Loan Session (Step-by-Step)

You can interrupt a loan session at any time and resume it later using the CLI. This is useful for long workflows or when you need to pause and continue later.

### Interrupting a Session
1. **Start a loan session** using the CLI:
   ```
   python run_loan_cli.py
   ```
2. **At any prompt**, press `Ctrl+C` to pause the session.
3. The session state will be saved automatically in the `session_data/` folder as a JSON file (named with timestamp and session ID).

### Resuming a Session

1. **Resume a session** by providing the session ID:
   ```
   python run_loan_cli.py <session_id>
   ```
   Replace `<session_id>` with the actual ID from the loan session which was paused.
3. The workflow will continue from where you left off.

### Additional Tips
- You can check the status of a session:
  ```
  python run_loan_cli.py --status <session_id>
  ```
- All session files are stored in `session_data/`.
- Interrupted sessions can be resumed multiple times until completed.
