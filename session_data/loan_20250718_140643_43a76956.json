    "input": "LOAN APPLICATION REQUEST: \"need loan\"\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - FOLLOW THIS SEQUENCE:\nIMPORTANT: After DataQuery step, you MUST check the response for salary-related actions before doing anything else!\n\n1. The loan purpose 'car loan' was detected from the initial request.\n2. ALWAYS submit this purpose to LoanPurposeAssessment to evaluate eligibility.\n   - If purpose is 'prohibited' (eligibility), stop processing and inform user.\n   - If purpose is 'conditionally_permitted', explain the conditions from policy_details.\n   - Only continue if purpose is 'permitted' or conditions are met.\n4. Ask for PAN/Aadhaar using UserInteraction.\n5. Query user data with DataQuery.\n\n6. **SALARY WORKFLOW - MANDATORY IMMEDIATE STEP**\n   CRITICAL: After DataQuery, check the response for special orchestrator messages!\n\n   **EXISTING USER** - If DataQuery response contains: \"_orchestrator_next_action\": \"salary_update_question\"\n   \u2192 This means an EXISTING USER was found and you MUST immediately ask:\n   \u2192 UserInteraction(\"Do you want to update your salary information?\")\n   \u2192 Wait for user response (YES/NO)\n   \u2192 If user says YES: UserInteraction(\"Please upload your salary PDF file path\")\n   \u2192 Then call PDFSalaryExtractor with the provided path\n   \u2192 If user says NO: Use UseExistingUserData tool to get the stored user data\n   \u2192 The UseExistingUserData tool returns the complete user data JSON\n   \u2192 For RiskAssessment, format as: UseExistingUserData_output|loan_amount\n\n   **NEW USER** - If DataQuery contains: \"status\": \"new_user_found_proceed_to_salary_sheet\"\n   \u2192 Your IMMEDIATE next action MUST be: UserInteraction(\"Please upload your salary information (PDF)\")\n   \u2192 Then MANDATORY call PDFSalaryExtractor with the provided PDF path\n   \u2192 Store the extracted user_data from PDFSalaryExtractor for RiskAssessment\n\n   **CRITICAL**: Only after completing the salary workflow above, proceed to collect city.\n   - If DataQuery returns 'user_found_but_pan_needed', handle PAN requirement securely:\n     * Store the COMPLETE JSON response from DataQuery\n     * Use UserInteraction: 'To fetch your credit score for loan processing, please provide your PAN number.'\n     * SECURITY: Use ValidatePANAadhaar with format: complete_dataquery_json|provided_pan\n     * EXAMPLE: If DataQuery returned {...full json...} and user provided ABCDE1234F, use: '{...full json...}|ABCDE1234F'\n     * If validation fails, inform user: 'PAN number does not match our records for this Aadhaar. Please provide the correct PAN.'\n     * If validation passes, use CreditScoreByPAN tool with the validated PAN number\n     * Continue with the complete validated user data\n**CRITICAL SEQUENCE ENFORCEMENT:**\n\nSTEP 5: DataQuery\nSTEP 6: Check DataQuery response immediately for orchestrator messages:\n  - If \"_orchestrator_next_action\": \"salary_update_question\" \u2192 Ask existing user salary update question  \n  - If \"status\": \"new_user_found_proceed_to_salary_sheet\" \u2192 Ask for PDF upload\nSTEP 7: Handle salary workflow (existing user update or new user PDF extraction)\n  - If existing user says NO: Use UseExistingUserData, then use output for RiskAssessment\n  - If existing user says YES: Use PDFSalaryExtractor\n  - If new user: Use PDFSalaryExtractor\nSTEP 8: Ask for city ONLY after salary workflow is complete\nSTEP 9: GeoPolicyCheck\nSTEP 10: RiskAssessment with correct user data:\n  - Format: user_data_json|loan_amount\n  - For NO salary update: UseExistingUserData_output|loan_amount\n  - For YES/new user: PDFSalaryExtractor_user_data|loan_amount\nSTEP 11: AgreementPresentation if approved\n\nDO NOT SKIP THE SALARY WORKFLOW IN STEP 6-7. For existing users, the orchestrator adds special messages to force this.\n7. **ONLY AFTER SALARY WORKFLOW IS COMPLETE**: Ask for city using UserInteraction.\n8. Run GeoPolicyCheck with format: city:CITY,purpose:PURPOSE,amount:AMOUNT.\n9. **MANDATORY**: Run RiskAssessment with the correct user data:\n   - For EXISTING USERS who said NO to salary update: Use user_data from UseExistingUserData tool\n   - For NEW USERS: Use the user_data extracted by PDFSalaryExtractor (MANDATORY)\n   - For EXISTING USERS who updated salary: Use the user_data from PDFSalaryExtractor\n10. **AGREEMENT STEP**: If loan is APPROVED by RiskAssessment, use AgreementPresentation to show terms.\n11. **FINAL STEP**: After presenting agreement, ask user for acceptance using UserInteraction and process response.\n\nIMPORTANT: Execute ONE action at a time. Wait for each tool response before proceeding to the next step.\nEven if GeoPolicyCheck shows conditions, you MUST still run RiskAssessment to get the complete picture.\nIf RiskAssessment shows APPROVED status, you MUST present the loan agreement using AgreementPresentation.\n\nEXECUTE ONE ACTION AT A TIME - DO NOT PLAN MULTIPLE STEPS IN ADVANCE.",
